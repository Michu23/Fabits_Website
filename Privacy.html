                <h4>
                    Voluntary Act
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The act of providing your Aadhaar is voluntary in nature, which will only be required for completing
                    your account opening procedure online and for digitally signing the Shareway Securities Limited
                    account opening form. Your Aadhaar may also be used as a proof of address as an alternative choice
                    to driver’s license(DL) or Passport copy, which is a voluntary decision to be made by You.<br />

                    You may alternatively choose to go through the offline route of account opening by physically
                    signing all such account opening documents, which does not require you to share your Aadhaar
                    information at all.

                </p>

                <h4>
                    Shareway Securities Limited does not store any Aadhaar information
                </h4>

                <p>
                    During your online account opening process, you do not input any Aadhaar details on the Fabits
                    platform. You would be issuing your Digital Aadhaar to Digi locker, from where Shareway Securities
                    Limited (Shareway Securities Limited is registered as a Requester on the Digi locker platform) would
                    receive information, based on your consent to allow Digi locker to share such information with
                    Shareway Securities Limited, limited to: (1) The last four digits of your Aadhaar / VID (Virtual ID
                    created on the UIDAI website), (2) Full Name, (3) Date of Birth, (4) Gender, (5) Address, and (6)
                    Your Photo.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Digi locker is a part of the National e-Governance Division under the Ministry of Electronics &
                    Information Technology (MeitY), Government of India. The Digital Aadhaar issued within Digi Locker
                    is the same as the eAadhaar issued by UIDAI (https://eaadhaar.uidai.gov.in). Digi Locker has
                    partnered with UIDAI to make it available automatically to its users when they link their Digi
                    Locker account with Aadhaar. This act of issuing an eAadhaar within Digi locker and subsequently
                    Digi locker sharing the information limited to the above points, leads to behaving as a physical
                    KYC. Shareway Securities Limited only receives information limited to the above points for the
                    purposes of completing KYC of clients online.

                </p>

                <p>
                    All clients may alternatively follow the offline route of account opening, which does not require
                    sharing any Aadhaar related information.
                </p>

                <p>
                    During your online account opening process, you would also be sharing your Aadhaar with Digiotech
                    Solutions Pvt. Ltd. for the purpose of digitally signing the Shareway Securities Limited account
                    opening form. Digiotech Solutions Pvt. Ltd. does not share your Aadhaar with Shareway Securities
                    Limited. After the account opening form has been digitally signed by you, a copy of the digitally
                    signed form would be emailed to you and to Shareway Securities Limited for reference/audit purposes.
                    Digiotech Solutions Pvt. Ltd. is a licensed e-Sign ASP (Application Services Provider) with CDAC,
                    compliant with the guidelines laid down by the Controller of Certifying Authorities (CCA), India and
